## 🧩 SQL Syntax Overview

### ✅ Key SQL Concepts Used

- `WITH` clause (CTE)
- `JOIN` across multiple tables
- `CASE` statements for logic branching
- `ROUND()` for numeric formatting

### 🔍 Sample Query

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `rakamin-kf-analytics-459814.kimia_farma.analysis_table` AS

WITH transaksi_dengan_margin AS (
  SELECT 
    t.transaction_id,
    t.date,
    c.branch_id,
    c.branch_name,
    c.kota,
    c.provinsi,
    c.rating AS rating_cabang,
    t.customer_name,
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    t.price AS actual_price,
    t.discount_percentage,
    (t.price - (t.price * t.discount_percentage / 100)) AS nett_sales,

    CASE 
        WHEN t.price <= 50000 THEN 0.10
        WHEN t.price > 50000 AND t.price <= 100000 THEN 0.15
        WHEN t.price > 100000 AND t.price <= 300000 THEN 0.20
        WHEN t.price > 300000 AND t.price <= 500000 THEN 0.25
        ELSE 0.30
    END AS persentase_gross_laba,

    t.rating AS rating_transaksi

  FROM `rakamin-kf-analytics-459814.kimia_farma.kf_final_transaction` t
  JOIN `rakamin-kf-analytics-459814.kimia_farma.kf_kantor_cabang` c 
    ON t.branch_id = c.branch_id
  JOIN `rakamin-kf-analytics-459814.kimia_farma.kf_product` p 
    ON t.product_id = p.product_id
)

SELECT *,
       ROUND(nett_sales * persentase_gross_laba, 2) AS nett_profit
FROM transaksi_dengan_margin;
```
